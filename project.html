        <p>>Nexzus Engineering Mega Services has made giant strides in the electricity industry in Nigeria. We were the first indigenous Nigerian–owned company to export power to another African country. Our landmark Emergency Power Generation Project in Sierra Leone remains a useful point of reference today.</p>

		<p>Nexzus Engineering Mega Services is also an industry leader in innovative electrical solutions. The “Income Electrix Corridor” (a double-pole arrangement with braced foundation) invented and deployed by Income Electrix Limited during the electrification of Okoroutip Town in Ibeno Local Government Area of Akwa-Ibom State, remains the most cost-effective and efficient way to erect overhead lines in swampy terrain.</p>
